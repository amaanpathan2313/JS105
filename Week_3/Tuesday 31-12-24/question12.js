// Problem Statement: 
//You are given a 2D array, whose dimensions are stored in two variables with the name Nand M
// The value stored in N denotes the number of rows, and the value in M denotes the number of columns
// The 2D array is stored in a variable with the name arr
// You have to print the sum of indexes of the 2D array for all positions in the 2D array
// For example, consider the value stored in N = 3,M = 2, and the array is arr = [1,2],[3,4],[5,6], then the required output will be

// At index (0,0), the sum of indexes becomes (0 + 0 = 0)
// At index (0,1), the sum of indexes becomes (0 + 1 = 1)
// At index (1,0), the sum of indexes becomes (1 + 0 = 1)
// At index (1,1), the sum of indexes becomes (1 + 1 = 2)
// At index (2,0), the sum of indexes becomes (2 + 0 = 2)
// At index (2,1), the sum of indexes becomes (2 + 1 = 3)

// Therefore, the output becomes
// 0 1
// 1 2
// 2 3

let arr = [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4],
    [5, 6]
];

// N denotes the number of rows : 2
// M denotes the number of columns : 2

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    let sum = "";
    for (let j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
          sum += (i + j) + " ";
    }
    console.log(sum);
}
